## For you
Doesn't matter if you're a Junior Web Developer or a Senior one, LinkedIn profile will make you get the dream job that you want.
This post will help you get a solid profile and get that job for you.

## 1st: Connections
LinkedIn is about connecting professional people in an area.
Since we are focusing on the Web Developer perspective, there's two main agents to take into account:
 - Developers: these are our teammates, former colleges, friends and acquaintances
 - Recruiters: these are our job enablers

Developers with more connections will connect with more recruiters reaching more jobs.

**ProTip**: make connections with anybody whether you know it or not isn't relevant at this point.

LinkedIn hidden feature is "500+" connections.
