## Issue

Mac is not showing me the update. What should I do?

## Solution

Look it up by its name.

![look up mojave in search bar][1]

It will show in the results as an Utility.

## Download

To get it click on GET (it’s free). It will start downloading about 5Gbs. 

## Install

Once downloaded it will request your attention to install it using a straightforward wizard. Then it will prompt for a restart, be careful since it takes about an hour to install. Press restart when you’re ready and next thing will be the boot up from the new OS X version!
